# scalla-project

A Scala implementation of algorithms for detecting anomalies in time-series data
(ZAnomalyDetector, SumSqrAnomalyDetector, LinearRegAnomalyDetector,
HybridAnomalyDetector, EntropyAnomalyDetector) with the aim to design the code
according to functional programming principles. 

The input is in csv files, there are csv files for train, and csv files for test. 

For starting the pogram to find anomalies, run MainTrain3.class .
